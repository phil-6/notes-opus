# Privacy Notes - Style Guide

This is the style guide for Privacy Notes. We aim to write code that is a pleasure to read, and we have a lot of opinions about how to do it well. Writing great code is an essential part of our programming culture, and we deliberately set a high bar for every code change anyone contributes.

We love discussing code. If you have questions about how to write something, or if you detect some smell you are not quite sure how to solve, please ask other programmers. A Pull Request is a great way to do this.

When writing new code, unless you are very familiar with our approach, try to find similar code elsewhere to look for inspiration.

## Core Principles

We want the code to be clean, maintainable, modular and reusable. We should use concerns and other sensible extractions where appropriate. Key principles are:

- **Keep it Simple**
- **Keep it as close to the Rails defaults as possible**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**

Our code should be predictable and self-explanatory. Naming things is hard, but we should take the time to name things well.

We should have a clear separation of concerns. Aim to avoid methods that have extra side effects. Classes should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

Efforts should be made to avoid "Clever" code. Simple, understandable code is always better than the complex "clever" solution. If you find yourself writing clever code, consider whether there is a simpler path. Can we break down the problem into smaller parts, or can we extract some of the complexity into a well named method or class?

We should often be WET before we are DRY. (Write Everything Twice before we Don't Repeat Ourselves). Two usages of something is often not enough to justify an abstraction, three usually is. Another case for extraction is to break up large files, classes or methods into smaller, more manageable pieces. Keeping SRP in mind.

## Method and Class Size

Keep methods short and focused. If a method is getting long (more than ~12 lines), consider breaking it into smaller, well-named private methods. Each method should do one thing well.

Similarly, keep classes focused on a single responsibility. If a class is growing beyond ~150 lines, consider whether it's doing too much and should be split.

These aren't hard rules, but they're good indicators that you should pause and consider refactoring.

## Comments and Documentation

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure, so comments are not generally needed. Comments should explain **why**, not **what** the code does.

**Good comments:**
- Explain business logic or domain-specific rules
- Document non-obvious decisions or trade-offs
- Clarify complex algorithms when simplification isn't possible
- Add context that isn't clear from the code itself

**Avoid comments that:**
- Restate what the code does (the code should be clear enough)
- Apologise for bad code (refactor instead)
- Are outdated or contradictory to the code

When you feel you need a comment to explain what code does, first try to refactor the code to be more self-explanatory through better naming or extraction.

## Rails Conventions

We should aim to keep our code as close to the Rails defaults as possible. This helps with maintainability, and makes it easier for new developers to get up to speed. It also makes upgrading Rails versions easier. Follow Rails conventions and idioms. Prioritize "Convention over Configuration".

### Minimal Dependencies

**Keep dependencies to an absolute minimum.** Every dependency is a liability that can break, require updates, or introduce security vulnerabilities.

**No Node.js Required:**
- This project runs entirely on Ruby/Rails
- We use importmap-rails for JavaScript (no npm, webpack, or node_modules)
- We use propshaft for asset pipeline (simpler than Sprockets)
- Tailwind CSS uses the standalone executable via tailwindcss-rails gem (no Node.js needed)
- Stimulus controllers are loaded via importmap

**Before Adding Any Dependency:**
1. Can Rails/Ruby do this already?
2. Can we write a simple solution ourselves?
3. Is the gem actively maintained?
4. What's the maintenance burden?
5. Does it require additional infrastructure (Node.js, Redis, etc.)?

**Prefer Rails Defaults:**
- Solid Queue over Sidekiq (no Redis required)
- Solid Cache over Redis/Memcached
- Solid Cable over Action Cable with Redis
- SQLite3 for development (simple, no server required)
- ActionText over third-party WYSIWYG editors
- Hotwire over React/Vue

### Gems and Libraries

We should avoid using additional gems where possible. We should discuss as a team before implementing new gems and clearly identify what pain they are solving and what benefits they bring.

Always use the latest stable version of gems and check their documentation for current best practices.

### Turbo and JavaScript

We should use Turbo wherever possible. Avoid adding additional JavaScript where Turbo can handle the job. We're using StimulusJS as the JS controller, which keeps things close to vanilla JS. Stimulus controllers should be small, lightweight, reusable and focused on a single task.

When we lazy load with a Turbo Frame, we should ensure that the response view renders a complete page (with layout) so if the route is accessed directly without Turbo, the user sees a proper page rather than orphaned content.

## Tailwind CSS

We use Tailwind CSS for styling.

We should keep Tailwind DRYish. If there is a particular combination of classes we use in multiple places, with the same intent, we should extract it to a component or an @apply directive in tailwind/application.css or one of the other css files.

## Testing

Controllers and models should have full test coverage.

Integration tests should usually match up with controller actions.

Key User flows should have system tests for the happy-path.

Tests should be small and focused. Split large tests into multiple test files with singular focus.

Prefer using fixtures for test data. Avoid using `create` in tests unless absolutely necessary. Performance in tests is important.

## Tooling

We use Rubocop to enforce consistent code style. Run `bin/rubocop` before committing to check for violations. The configuration is in `.rubocop.yml`.

We use Tailwind for CSS. We try and keep styles DRY where appropriate.

We use Brakeman for static analysis and security checks.

We use Pagy for pagination (latest stable version).

## i18n

All user facing strings should be i18n'd. Use sensible keys that match the structure of the application. For example, user profile related strings should go under `users.profile.*`.

## Routing

Typically, our routes should be RESTful and resourceful. Generally, we should avoid custom routes.

When we do create custom routes, they should be descriptive of the action they perform.

## Database & Performance

- **Eager loading**: Use `includes`, `preload`, or `eager_load` to prevent N+1 queries. When you add an association that will be accessed in a loop, think about whether it needs eager loading.
- **Indexes**: Consider adding indexes when adding foreign keys or columns that will be used in WHERE or ORDER BY clauses.
- **No queries from views**: Keep database queries in controllers and models. Views should only render data that's already been loaded—this keeps the view layer simple and makes N+1 issues easier to spot.

## Methods Ordering

We order methods in classes in the following order:

1. `class` methods
2. `public` methods with `initialize` at the top.
3. `private` methods

## Invocation Order

We order methods vertically based on their invocation order. This helps us to understand the flow of the code.

```ruby
class SomeClass
  def some_method
    method_1
    method_2
  end

  private
  def method_1
    method_1_1
    method_1_2
  end

  def method_1_1
    # ...
  end

  def method_1_2
    # ...
  end

  def method_2
    method_2_1
    method_2_2
  end

  def method_2_1
    # ...
  end

  def method_2_2
    # ...
  end
end
```

## To Bang or Not to Bang

Should I call a method `do_something` or `do_something!`?

As a general rule, we only use `!` for methods that have a correspondent counterpart without `!`. In particular, we don't use `!` to flag destructive actions. There are plenty of destructive methods in Ruby and Rails that do not end with `!`.

## Visibility Modifiers

We don't add a newline under visibility modifiers, and we don't indent the content under them.

```ruby
class SomeClass
  def some_method
    # ...
  end

  private
  def some_private_method_1
    # ...
  end

  def some_private_method_2
    # ...
  end
end
```

## Controller and Model Interactions

In general, we favour a vanilla Rails approach with thin controllers directly invoking a rich domain model. We avoid using services or other artifacts to connect the two.

Invoking plain Active Record operations is totally fine:

```ruby
class Cards::CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @comment = @card.comments.create!(comment_params)
  end
end
```

For more complex behaviour, we prefer clear, intention-revealing model APIs that controllers call directly:

```ruby
class Cards::GoldnessesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @card.gild
  end
end
```

When justified, it is fine to use services or form objects, but don't treat those as special artifacts:

```ruby
Signup.new(email_address: email_address).create_identity
```

Naming of class types is descriptive in Rails. A service is a class that performs some sort of service. It performs an action. Don't overthink it.

## Run Async Operations in Jobs

As a general rule, we write shallow job classes that delegate the logic itself to domain models or services. Job classes should not contain any logic themselves.

* We typically use the suffix `_later` to flag methods that enqueue a job.
* A common scenario is having a model class that enqueues a job that, when executed, invokes some method in that same class. In this case, we use the suffix `_now` for the regular synchronous method.

```ruby
module Event::Relaying
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    after_create_commit :relay_later
  end

  def relay_later
    Event::RelayJob.perform_later(self)
  end

  def relay_now
    # ...
  end
end

class Event::RelayJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(event)
    event.relay_now
  end
end
```

## Accessibility

We should be mindful of accessibility as we build. A few things to keep in mind:

- Prefer semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<button>`, etc.) over generic divs and spans
- Add ARIA attributes where semantic HTML alone isn't enough to convey meaning
- Ensure interactive elements can be used with a keyboard
- Provide text alternatives for images and icons where appropriate

## Security Considerations

Security should be built into our code from the start. Rails comes with many built-in protections, but we should be mindful of common pitfalls:

- **Strong parameters**: Always use strong parameters in controllers to whitelist attributes
- **Authorization**: Check permissions before performing actions (use policies/pundit where appropriate)
- **Authentication**: Ensure users are authenticated for protected actions
- **SQL injection**: Use ActiveRecord's query interface; parameterize raw SQL queries
- **XSS protection**: Rails escapes output by default; only use `raw` or `html_safe` when necessary and with sanitised input
- **Mass assignment**: Use strong parameters; be careful with `permit!`
- **Sensitive data**: Never log passwords, tokens, or other sensitive information
- **CSRF protection**: Don't disable CSRF protection without good reason
